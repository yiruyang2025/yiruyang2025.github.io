Welcome âœ¨!
This one is actually a little bit difficult for me to write, with aging, my short-term memory is no longer as good as it used to be :).<br><br>


# 1.Introduction<br><br>

We'll discuss the main benchmarking metrics used in current industry practice.<br><br><br><br>


# 2. Recent Benchmark Frameworks

## 2.1 Evaluation Metrics for Text-to-Speech (TTS)

| Year | Metric | Description | Typical Range |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1996 | **MOS (Mean Opinion Score)** | Subjective quality assessment covering naturalness and intelligibility | 1 â€“ 5 (â†‘ better) |
| 2001 | **PESQ** | Objective perceptual quality score; correlates well with MOS | â€“0.5 â€“ 4.5 (â†‘ better) |
| 2011 | **STOI** | Short-Time Objective Intelligibility; predicts speech intelligibility | 0 â€“ 1 (â†‘ better) |
| 2018 | **Speaker Similarity** | Cosine similarity (or ABX preference) between synthesized and target voices | 0 â€“ 1 (â†‘ better) |
| 2004 | **MCD (Mel-Cepstral Distortion)** | Spectral distance between generated and reference mel-cepstra | < 6 dB (â†“ better) |
| 2003 | **F0 RMSE** | Root-mean-square error of pitch contour versus reference | lower is better |

## 2.2 Evaluation Metrics for Voice Conversion (VC)

| Year | Metric | Description | Typical Range |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1996 | **MOS** | Overall converted-speech quality & naturalness | 1 â€“ 5 (â†‘ better) |
| 2010 | **Speaker Identification Accuracy** | Percent of listeners (or ASV system) correctly identifying the intended speaker | 0 â€“ 100 % (â†‘ better) |
| 2018 | **x-vector Cosine Similarity** | Cosine similarity of deep speaker embeddings before/after conversion | 0 â€“ 1 (1 = perfect match) |
| 2000 | **MFCC-DTW Distance** | Dynamic-time-warping distance between MFCC trajectories of source and converted speech | lower is better |
| 2011 | **Intelligibility Score** | Speech clarity; often STOI or ASR-based word-error-rate proxy | metric-specific (â†‘ better) |
| 2004 | **Spectral Distortion** | Aggregate frequency-domain error (e.g., log-spectral distortion) | lower is better |

## 2.3 Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) Benchmarks

| Year | Metric | Description | Typical Range |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1996 | **MOS** | Overall naturalness of translated speech | 1 â€“ 5 (â†‘ better) |
| 2010 | **Speaker Identification Accuracy** | Retention of original speaker identity across languages | 0 â€“ 100 % (â†‘ better) |
| 2018 | **x-vector Cosine Similarity** | Embedding-level speaker match after translation | 0 â€“ 1 (1 = perfect match) |
| 2000 | **MFCC-DTW Distance** | Spectro-temporal alignment error between source and translated speech | lower is better |
| 2011 | **Intelligibility Score** | Clarity of translated content; STOI or ASR-based | metric-specific (â†‘ better) |
| 2004 | **Spectral Distortion** | Frequency content preservation in the translated signal | lower is better |
