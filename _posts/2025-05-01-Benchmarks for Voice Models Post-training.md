Welcome âœ¨!
THis one is actually a little bit difficult for me to write, with aging, my short-term memory is no longer as good as it used to be :).<br><br>



# 1.Introduction<br><br>

We'll discuss the main benchmarking metrics used in current industry practice.<br><br><br><br>


# 2.Recent Benchmark Frameworks<br><br>

**2.1 Evaluation Metrics for Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

| Year | Metric                           | Description            | Typical Range                            |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Year | MOS (Mean Opinion Score) | Subjective quality assessment: naturalness & intelligibility | 1-5 (higher is better)    |
| Year | PESQ   | Objective voice quality measure, correlates with MOS  | -0.5 to 4.5                         |
| Year | STOI  | Short-Time Objective Intelligibility: measures speech intelligibility   | 0 to 1 (higher is better)   |
| Year | Speaker similarity  | Measures how well synthesized voice matches target speaker   | Usually cosine similarity |
| Year | Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD)  | Distance between generated and ground truth mel-cepstra | < 6 dB (lower is better  |
| Year | F0 RMSE  | Root mean squared error for pitch contour | Lower is better |

**2.2 Evaluation Metrics for Voice Conversion (VC)**


| Year | Metric                           | Description            | Typical Range                            |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Year | MOS (Mean Opinion Score)| Assess overall quality and naturalness | 1-5 (higher is better)    |
| Year | Speaker Identification Accuracy   | Evaluate speaker similarity preservation |Percentage of correct identification   |
| Year | x-vector cosine similarity| Measure speaker identity preservation  | 0-1 (1 = perfect match) |
| Year | MFCC-DTW distance| Dynamic time warping distance between MFCCs | Lower is better  |
| Year | Intelligibility score | Measure converted speech clarity | Usually MOS or automatic methods  |
| Year | Spectral distortion| Measure frequency content preservation | Lower distortion = better quality|

**2.3 Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) Benchmarks**

| Year | Metric                           | Description            | Typical Range                            |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Year | MOS (Mean Opinion Score)| Assess overall quality and naturalness | 1-5 (higher is better)    |
| Year | Speaker Identification Accuracy   | Evaluate speaker similarity preservation |Percentage of correct identification   |
| Year | x-vector cosine similarity| Measure speaker identity preservation  | 0-1 (1 = perfect match) |
| Year | MFCC-DTW distance| Dynamic time warping distance between MFCCs | Lower is better  |
| Year | Intelligibility score | Measure converted speech clarity | Usually MOS or automatic methods  |
| Year | Spectral distortion| Measure frequency content preservation | Lower distortion = better quality|
