Welcome！✨ 

Here are my main takeaways:

- Always cherish those 'Real' Moments in your life
- Nothing's more important than our own families and good friends
- For everything else, just BE PATIENT :)
- Beliefs are always important
- Also! Always remember to Connect Your Own Dots!

- "The prepared mind sooner or later finds things important and does it" - Richard Hamming, Thus, "try to be well prepared at most times in your life" - my own best [Grandpa](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%8E%8B%E5%B8%B8%E6%B5%A9/657595)
