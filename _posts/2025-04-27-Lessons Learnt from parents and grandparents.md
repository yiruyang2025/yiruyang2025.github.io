Welcome :)

Here are my main takeaways:

- Always cherish those 'Real' Moments in your life
- Nothing's more important than our own families and good friends
- Beliefs are always important
- When you still have energy and passion, build your own bridge and Garden 🌁
- Always remember to Connect Your Own Dots

- For everything else, just BE PATIENT :)

- "The prepared mind sooner or later finds things important and does it" - [Richard Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming), Thus, "try to be well prepared at most times in your life" - my own the Best Grandpa
